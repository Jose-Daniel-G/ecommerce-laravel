Based on the course structure you provided, the total number of chapters is 68. Since you've already completed up to chapter 27, you have 41 chapters left (68‚àí27=41).

The time it will take you to finish the course largely depends on your study pace and consistency in the remaining 41 chapters.

Estimated Completion Time üóìÔ∏è
Here are some estimations based on different possible paces:

Pace	Chapters per Day	Remaining Chapters	Estimated Days to Finish	Approximate Completion
Intense	5	41	~8 days	Just over 1 week
Steady	3	41	~14 days	About 2 weeks
Relaxed	1	41	41 days	About 6 weeks (1.5 months)

Keep in mind:

Chapter Length/Complexity: If the remaining chapters are longer or cover more complex topics (like the product CRUD and shopping cart), you might need to allocate more time for those.

Practice: The best way to learn to program is to practice. Make sure you're not just watching the videos but actively writing the code and doing the exercises. This might slow down your completion time but will greatly increase your learning.

You're already doing great by reaching chapter 27! Keep up the momentum.
